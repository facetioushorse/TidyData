This code book explains the data contained in the tidy_data.txt file that is saved after running the run_analysis.R script.

Each row represents the average of the measured data for one subject performing one activity.

Identifiers:

"subject" - integer number representing which subject the data are from, ranges from 1-30.
"activity" - the activity of the subject when the measurements were taken. Values are "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", AND "LAYING"
